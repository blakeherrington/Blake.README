## Welcome!

You found the office, logged into your computer, and inevitably found this document! You're doing great so far! 

You might be wondering why I'm asking you to read this. I'm making this as an experiment and it's a work in progress, your feedback on it would be appreciated.

#### Why this document exists:
- You get to know me as a human being
- I'm able to refine my own thoughts and be intentional in sharing them
- I can explain what you can expect from me and how we work at AppFolio

Important: This is NOT meant as a replacement for actually getting to know each other.

## About Me

I grew up here in San Diego and joined AppFolio in January 2016 - I joined the San Diego office to be a part of starting the first AppFolio Property Manager team based in San Diego and the rest is history.

I live in La Mesa with my wife and our animal children (2 dogs, 1 cat, 1 bunny). I enjoy traveling, animals, and playing video games.

Personally, I'm a pretty self-motivated/achiever type personality (Type 3 if you've heard of the Enneagram). This means that I really enjoy working in a way that has tangible, measurable results. I love the feeling of accomplishment at the end of a project where I can feel proud of my work. In the same way, I love supporting and seeing the people around me take on massive challenges and grow as a result.

## About AppFolio

AppFolio's company values are as follows: 
 - Simpler is Better
 - Great, Innovative Products are Key to a Great Business
 - Great People Make a Great Company
 - Listening to Customers is in Our DNA
 - Small, Focused Teams Keep us Agile
 - We Do the Right Thing, It's Good for Business
 
These values were derived early in our history. They are not aspirational, they were created from who we actually are. Many companies have values, but in my experience very few practice them as diligently as we do at AppFolio.

Read these values a few times and watch for when you see them practiced. If you observe instances of these values not being practiced, let's talk about it!

I joined AppFolio because of these values and our culture and the way we live them out is one of the things that makes me stay. AppFolio is an incredible company, and this does not happen on accident. As an AppFolian, you are now a part of building our future and representing these values to your teammates and in the way we work for our customers.

## About You and Me (I'm your manager!)

As your manager, my job is to give you support, feedback, and set expectations and goals with you to help you be a successful and productive engineer here at AppFolio. I hope that you'll find that I truly do care about you and your career. I want to earn your trust and support you as you grow as a human being and as we build an incredible product to serve our customers.

We will regularly have 1:1s meetings. Our time together is for you to take advantage of. In my experience, the best 1:1s focus beyond the moment. We can discuss career development, team strategy, opportunity, company decisions, and also just use the time to develop a friendship. I have found it helpful to keep notes of discussion topics that I want to remember for 1:1 conversations. Also - even when my calendar looks busy, there are few things I'm doing that are more important than talking with you. Please feel free to grab me any time there's something you want to talk about.

As a rule, I want to set context instead of attempt to control. I don’t ever want to tell you _how_ to do your job. You were hired because you are smart, talented and capable of making decisions. I want you to feel empowered to make decisions and be ok with making mistakes. We can work together to get things patched up when mistakes are made. I do not want to micromanage you, but instead empower you to make your own decisions regarding your team’s work.

I’m a human being just like you - _PLEASE_ disagree with me, and tell me when I screw up (because I will). I’m not offended by disagreement or feedback. I will always be honest with you. You can ask me anything - sometimes I won’t be able to share information, and I will be transparent about that. I ask you to do the same for me in return.

I will push you. I'll work hard to set clear expectations with you about what you need to do in order to be successful at AppFolio. I'll give you direct feedback when necessary. Ask me about the "Learning Zone Model".

## About your Team

"Small, Focused Teams Keep us Agile" - You will join a team after you finish your onboarding. Our teams work with a high level of autonomy and responsibilty in their work. Decisions about what we do, how we do it, and when we're done are all decisions that the team will make together. You and your team will have ownership over what you do, and you'll celebrate your success.

This can sound overwhelming at first, but you'll find that it's an extremely fullfilling and exciting way to work that also results in us accomplishing great things at the benefit of our customers. It will take some time to get your bearings, but I encourage you to dive in head first. When we make mistakes on a team, we learn from them.

Once you get your footing on the team, let's talk about what makes a team successful at Appfolio.

## The Practical Stuff

In general, I will assume that you take your job extremely seriously and that you are here to build a great product and a great company - all for the benefit of our customers. If this is true about you, you'll be happy here at AppFolio.

Most people come into the office around 9:00AM and leave around 6:00PM. You are welcome to shift your working hours as you please. When you join a team, you will have a daily standup early in the day and it is of course important that your schedule accomodates you being there on time every day.

At AppFolio we have a really fun, open environment. We have a game room and people are often doing some sort of activity at lunch. These things exist both because of our success as a company and because of their inherent benefit (often taking a break helps you move forward, health is important, etc.). I encourage you to engage in our office activities and enjoy the great culture that makes AppFolio so special, but be responsible and be conscious of how you manage your time.

## My Advice for You

Identify and meet needs - You will be successful here at AppFolio by identifying needs on your team or in the organization and making yourself the person that meets those needs. Take ownership. Buy-in to the company vision and goals and help us get there. In doing so, you'll grow your career and enjoy the success that hard work brings.

Be honest - Share your ideas for your project, questions about how things work, and feedback about how things are going. The more honest you can be with me and the people around you, the more we will be able to help you be happy and successful in your work.

Take risks - When you join your team, dive into your project and do everything you can to make it successful. When you recognize that you're nervous about a big challenge, that's a good sign that you're pushing yourself.


I can't wait to get you know you and I'm so excited to work with you!

Blake
